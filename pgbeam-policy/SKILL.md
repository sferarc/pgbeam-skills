# Author a PgBeam policy profile

A policy profile is a named bundle of enforcement rules that PgBeam applies in
the Postgres wire protocol for any agent credential attached to it: access mode,
table allow and deny lists, per-statement-kind rules, PII masking, per-relation
row filters, query and egress budgets, and write mode. Define it once, attach it
to a project default or to a specific agent credential, and it is enforced on
every query with no change to the upstream database.

Start restrictive and widen deliberately. The safe default is read-only, no
tables allowed until you name them, PII masked, and a budget set.

## The pieces of a profile

- **`access_mode`** (`read_only` or `read_write`). Read-only is the default and
  the right starting point for an agent. Read-write still respects the
  statement, allowlist, masking, and budget rules below.
- **`table_allowlist` / `table_denylist`**. What the credential may touch. If an
  allowlist is set, only those relations are visible and queryable; everything
  else is dropped, including from schema discovery, so the agent never learns it
  exists. Relations may be schema-qualified (`public.users`) or bare (`users`).
- **`statement_rules`** (`allow` / `deny` over statement kinds: `select`,
  `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `ddl`, `copy`, `set`, `show`, `explain`,
  `transaction`). An empty allow means every kind the access mode permits.
- **`masking_rules`**. Per-column masking applied to results in flight. Each rule
  has a `table`, a `column`, and a `kind`: `redact` (replace with a token),
  `null` (return NULL), or `hash` (SHA-256 hex, which keeps the same value
  mapping to the same output so joins still work).
- **`row_filters`**. A boolean SQL expression per relation that scopes which rows
  the credential can read, applied like an always-on `WHERE`.
- **Budgets and limits**: `budget_queries_per_hour`, `budget_queries_per_day`,
  `max_rows`, `statement_timeout_ms`, `egress_bytes_per_day`. Cap runaway loops
  and large scans.
- **`write_mode`** and the approval fields (`approval_mode`,
  `approval_auto_max_rows`, `approval_timeout_seconds`) gate writes and can route
  risky statements through human approval when read-write is enabled.

## Author it with the CLI

Fastest path. Create a profile, set masking and access mode, and attach it:

```bash
pgbeam policies create --name "Read-only analytics" \
  --access-mode read_only \
  --allow-table public.orders \
  --allow-table public.customers \
  --mask customers.email=hash \
  --mask customers.ssn=redact \
  --mask customers.phone=null \
  --max-rows 10000

# Attach as the project default, or to one credential:
pgbeam projects update --default-policy-profile <pol_id>
pgbeam agents create --name analytics --policy-profile <pol_id>
```

See `pgbeam policies --help` and https://pgbeam.com/docs/policies for the full
flag set (row filters, budgets, timeouts, write mode).

## Author it as code (Terraform)

Preferred for anything reviewed or reproducible. The `pgbeam_policy_profile`
resource defines the whole policy; other resources reference it by id.

```hcl
resource "pgbeam_policy_profile" "analytics" {
  project_id  = pgbeam_project.app.id
  name        = "Read-only analytics"
  access_mode = "read_only"

  table_allowlist = ["public.orders", "public.customers"]

  masking_rules = [
    { table = "public.customers", column = "email", kind = "hash" },
    { table = "public.customers", column = "ssn", kind = "redact" },
    { table = "public.customers", column = "phone", kind = "null" },
  ]

  row_filters = [
    { table = "public.orders", expression = "region = 'eu'" },
  ]

  max_rows                = 10000
  budget_queries_per_hour = 1000
  statement_timeout_ms    = 5000
  write_mode              = "normal"
}

resource "pgbeam_agent_credential" "analytics" {
  project_id        = pgbeam_project.app.id
  name              = "analytics-agent"
  policy_profile_id = pgbeam_policy_profile.analytics.id
}
```

Set a project-wide floor with `default_policy_profile_id` on `pgbeam_project`, or
scope per credential with `policy_profile_id` on `pgbeam_agent_credential`. The
same profile shape is available through the TS SDK (`createPolicyProfile`) and
the Go SDK. Import an existing profile with
`terraform import pgbeam_policy_profile.analytics <project_id>/<id>`.

## How to reason about a profile

- **Deny by construction, not by hope.** An allowlist plus read-only means the
  agent cannot reach a table you did not name, so a prompt injection has a small
  blast radius by default.
- **Mask, do not just hide.** Masked columns stay visible in the schema so the
  agent can join and reason about shape, but real PII never leaves the wire.
  Prefer `hash` for identifiers the agent needs to join on, `redact` or `null`
  for free-text or sensitive fields it should ignore.
- **Budget every credential.** A `max_rows` and a per-hour query cap turn a
  runaway agent loop into a bounded, audited event instead of a database
  incident.
- **Changes stream live.** Updated profiles propagate to the data plane without
  a redeploy, so tightening a policy takes effect on the next query.
