# PgBeam agent skills

Installable [agent skills](https://agentskills.io) that teach an AI coding agent
to use [PgBeam](https://pgbeam.com) for safe Postgres access. Each skill is a
`SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and a body the agent
reads when a task matches.

| Skill                                             | What it teaches                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`pgbeam-connect`](./pgbeam-connect/SKILL.md)     | Wire an AI agent to Postgres safely: get a scoped credential, choose a guarded connection string or the hosted MCP endpoint, and paste-ready Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code config. |
| [`pgbeam-policy`](./pgbeam-policy/SKILL.md)       | Author a policy profile as code: access mode, table allow and deny lists, PII masking, row filters, budgets, write mode, with CLI and Terraform.                                      |
| [`pgbeam-mcp-usage`](./pgbeam-mcp-usage/SKILL.md) | Drive the hosted Postgres MCP tools well once connected: prefer `schema_catalog`, read the policy errors, work within read-only and masking.                                          |

## Install

With the open skills tool:

```bash
npx skills add pgbeam-connect
```

Or copy a `SKILL.md` into your agent's skills directory (for example
`.claude/skills/pgbeam-connect/SKILL.md` for Claude Code, or `.agents/skills/`
for the cross-agent standard).

Agents can also discover these skills over HTTP from the PgBeam site, which
serves a machine-readable index with per-skill integrity digests:

- Index: `https://pgbeam.com/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`
- Each body: `https://pgbeam.com/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
